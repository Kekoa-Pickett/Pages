## Programmer
I am in my third year and have been focused on learning a variety of types of computer science, including multiple languages and levels of software. I have internship experience one summer where I was a software engineer intern for the company Creative Electron in San Marcos, which is in the north part of San Diego. There, I used python and had to import things through the code:

``` from PySide2 import QtCore, QtWidgets
from PySide2.QtWidgets import QMainWindow, QTreeView, QLineEdit
from PySide2.QtGui import QFont, QColor, QStandardItemModel, QStandardItem, QKeyEvent 
```

To get to my repository for CSE 110, [this link](Pages/README.md) takes you to my README doc for the class. As far as my future, I am currently open to most types of Computer Software with my favorites being:
1. Game Design/ Virtual Reality
2. Artificial Intellegence
3. Software Engineering
4. Data science

And **least** favorite topics include:
1. Theory 
2. Cyber Security
3. System Architecture

##  Personal
I love sports, especially basketball and football. My favorite team is the Miami Heat. Sports and being active is a huge part of my life, but another thing I enjoy is helping inspire kids to achieve more than they are "_expected_" to accomplish. I have taught computer science lessons to some students in underprivledged schools which has been really cool to expand their minds. One good movie I actually watched semi-recently was _Spiderman-Across the Spider-Verse_ and my favorite quote was when Miles Morales says 
> Nah, Imma do my own thing.

I love to compete and test my limits whether in sports or anything else. I love to hear and learn from others so that I can imagine new possibilities based on what I hear.
On campus, I am apart of:
- National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)
- Tau Beta Pi (National Honors Engineering Society)
- Formally a part of HKN Outreach - Teaching Computer Science to K-12 students

My recent/next goals in life include:
- [x] Joining on-campus clubs
- [x] Going to conference
- [x] Doing outreach events
- [ ] Getting an internship or co-op
- [ ] Creating a project outside of class
- [ ] Figuring out what specifically I want to specialize in
- [ ] Finding a career _hopefully in San Diego or remote_
